# DIO - Backend with Java 2024 - Project Challenge

### Challenge
The aim of this hands-on practical project is to reinforce knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java by implementing a bootcamp.

#### Proposal
Let's ABSTRACT the Bootcamp DOMAIN and MODEL its ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS. To do this, CLASSES will be created and related: Bootcamp, Courses, Mentoring and Devs.

The CLASSES Course, Mentoring and Devs will also be MODELED, i.e. ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS will be created.

To make the code more readable and easier to maintain, some of the tools that the OBJECT ORIENTATION PARADIGM (OOP) offers us will be used: ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM.

##### Bootcamp domain:
